         <h3>
            What kind of files can I open on Kantan Manga?
         </h3>
         <p>
            Kantan Manga only supports ZIP, RAR, CBZ and CBR files
         </p>
         <h3>
            What CBZ / CBR mean?
         </h3>
         <a>
         CBZ is just a fancy name for a ZIP of images. <br />
         CBR is just a fancy name for a RAR of images.
         </a>
         <h3>
            Where can I get CBZ / CBR files?
         </h3>
         <p>
            Because of the nature of the file format, it's not easy to find legal sources. A good way to get some mangas to start reading is to download ブ ラ ッ ク ジ ャ ッ ク に よ ろ し く from <a href="https://densho810.com/free/">here</a> and convert the PDFs to CBZs (remember, a CBZ is a zip file of images)

         <h3>
            Can I import EPWING dictionaries?
         </h3>
         <p>
            Yes but not directly. EPWING is a dead undocumented format, trying to deal with it directly is time-consuming and very prone to errors. Instead, Kantan Manga supports dictionaries in the format used by the pop-up dictionary browser extension <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">Yomichan</a>. You should be able to import any Yomichan dictionary into Kantan Manga, this includes EPWINGs converted to Yomichan format. Please note that terms tags are not yet supported, but will be soon.

            Where can I get dictionary files?
         </h3>
         <p>
            A list of free dictionaries can be found at the <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/index.html#dictionaries"> Yomichan documentation </a>.
