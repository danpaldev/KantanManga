         <h3>
            Can I import EPWING dictionaries?
         </h3>
         <p>
            Yes but not directly. EPWING is a dead undocumented format, trying to deal with it directly is time-consuming and very prone to errors. Instead, Kantan Manga supports dictionaries in the format used by the pop-up dictionary browser extension <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">Yomichan</a>. You should be able to import any Yomichan dictionary into Kantan Manga, this includes EPWINGs converted to Yomichan format. Please note that terms tags are not yet supported, but will be soon.
